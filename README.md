# CEM-DD2370
Sharing assignment code and figures.

## Module 1
Error and complexity studies are in `python/` and `julia/`. The same thing is implemented in both languages because I'm more used to python and could practise julia more easily.

Convergence test is in `matlab/module_1`.

## Module 2
The `matlab/module_2/poisson` has the Gauss-Seidel
convegence study
and `matlab/module_2/eigenvalue`
contains the finite-difference
eigenvalue problem in 1D and 3D.

In `julia/` the FDTD propagation
is studied. And in `python/`
 **Pymeep** is used to mimic a
 tutorial and to solve the
 eigenvalue problem in 3D.
